### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**DidierMorandi/didiermorandi** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Computer-Aided Hieroglyphs Translation, mainly on how to decipher hieroglyphs with my smartphone one day...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Egyptology at the Paul ValÃ©ry Montpellier 3 University
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on restarting the Tomb Reader Project (see https://tombreaderapp.com/)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with iOS programming (as the Tomb Reader App runs on Android only, these days) 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about GTAV Online :-)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: didier.morandi at gmail dot com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm 71 !
